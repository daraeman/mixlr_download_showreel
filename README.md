# Mixlr Download Showreel
Adds links to download Showreel broadcasts on Mixlr.

The download link is added next to the social media icons.

A button to mark a broadcast as saved is added next to the download link.

A "List Links" button is added add the top of the page, and populates a textbox with newline delimited links of all the broadcasts on the current page that haven't been marked as downloaded. It also allows for hiding the textbox when shown.

A "Mark All Downloaded" button is also added add the top of the page. It marks all broadcasts on the current page as downloaded, and changes to "Unmark All Downloaded" when all the shows on the current page have been marked as such.
