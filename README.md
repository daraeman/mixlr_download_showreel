# Mixlr Download Showreel
Adds links to download Showreel broadcasts on Mixlr.

The download link is added next to the social media icons.

A button to mark a broadcast as saved is added next to the download link.

A "List Links" button is added add the top of the page, and populates a textbox with newline delimited links of all the broadcasts on the current page that haven't been marked as downloaded. It also allows for hiding the textbox when shown.
